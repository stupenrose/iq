/**
 * Environment variables.
 *
 * <p>
 * While all the platforms I tested (Linux 2.6, Solaris, and Windows XP) have the case sensitive
 * environment variable table, Windows batch script handles environment variable in the case preserving
 * but case <b>insensitive</b> way (that is, cmd.exe can get both FOO and foo as environment variables
 * when it's launched, and the "set" command will display it accordingly, but "echo %foo%" results in
 * echoing the value of "FOO", not "foo" &mdash; this is presumably caused by the behavior of the underlying
 * Win32 API <tt>GetEnvironmentVariable</tt> acting in case insensitive way.) Windows users are also
 * used to write environment variable case-insensitively (like %Path% vs %PATH%), and you can see many
 * documents on the web that claims Windows environment variables are case insensitive.
 *
 * <p>
 * So for a consistent cross platform behavior, it creates the least confusion to make the table
 * case insensitive but case preserving.
 *
 * <p>
 * In Jenkins, often we need to build up "environment variable overrides"
 * on master, then to execute the process on slaves. This causes a problem
 * when working with variables like <tt>PATH</tt>. So to make this work,
 * we introduce a special convention <tt>PATH+FOO</tt> &mdash; all entries
 * that starts with <tt>PATH+</tt> are merged and prepended to the inherited
 * <tt>PATH</tt> variable, on the process where a new process is executed.
